--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
README
* make sure file name of THIS file is Input-Parameter-File.txt
* make sure, THIS file is in same directory as program

FORMAT: eg "valuename = 0.5 # remark"
* need spaces before and after " = "
* need space AFTER value, everything after space is ignored
* please ONLY insert values, everything else needs to stay the same!!!!
* path: end with / or \ , NO SPACES INCLUDED (eg DONT use path: "C:\\My ASG Files\")
* number format: 56.789
* matrix format: [x,z] 
* values in mm

PARAMETERS:
* [x,z]
* size: complete dimension; actual edge <-> actual edge of element
* edge: eg tiles mounted on module leave part of module unused (fe DAS)
	then "edge" is distance of actual edge of module to point where tile starts
* gap: distance between 2 elements of same kind
* N: number of elements IN ONE DIMENSION (eg if number of pixels on one tile = 32x32: [x,z] = [32,32])
     (NOT total number of elements)

INSERT VALUES IN THIS SECTION

'''FILE'''  -> 4 inputs
GRIDTYPE = 2D      # select one: 1D / 2D
OUTpath  = THIS    # use 'THIS' if want to save in current dir, otherwise eg C:/ASG/gridfiles/ 
OUTname  = example8x6
FILETYPE = igs    # select one: STLA / IGES

'''GRID PARAMETERS'''  -> 2 inputs
GridRatio = 8      # GR = height / thickness of grid
th_grid   = 0.2    # thickness of leaves

'''SYSTEM PARAMETERS'''  -> 2 inputs
SDD                = 120
EdgeAxisDifference = [-12.2,-6.2]   # origin of coordinate system -> if want to have have half a pixel shift, include here 
		                    # EAD given in negative values
		                    # EAD is left front edge of module (actual edge; "edge M0" gets added to EAD)

'''MODULE'''  -> 5 inputs
size_M   = [50,50]   # if size of module not known, it can be calculated, in this case leave blank:  = []
edge_M0  = [0,0]     # "left" side (directly behind CSO)
edge_M1  = [0,0]     # "right" side
gap_M    = 0         # between Modules (only important, if several modules stacked in z-direction)
nnn      = 0         # specifies, which module in z-direction is used

'''TILES'''  -> 4 inputs
edge_T0 = [0,0]
edge_T1 = [0,0]
gap_T   = [0.5, 0.5]
N_T     = [3,2]

'''PIXEL'''  -> 3 inputs
N_P    = [2,4]           # number of pixels ON TILE in each dimension (NOT number of total pixels on module)
size_P = [1.12, 0.922]   # optional, only needed if size of module not known (otherwise don't care)
gap_P  = [0.2,0.2]       # optional, only needed if size of module not known (otherwise don't care)
